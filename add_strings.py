# Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

# You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). 
# You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
# num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
# 

# Test Cases:
 
    # Example 1:

    # Input: 
    #     num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
    # Output: 
    #     "134"

    # Example 2:

    # Input: 
    #     num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
    # Output: 
    #     num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
