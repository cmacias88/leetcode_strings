        - keep count of the times a letter occurs in a string 
    
    If the key-value pairs of the two strings are identical or the contents of the 
    dictionary, then the strings are anagrams of each other. 

    Alternative Solutions:
        If the sorted function is allowed: 
            - a list is created from both strings and then alphabeticallly ordered, so 
                you can compare if the two are identical.
